**General stuff**

I'm a professor in the [Linguistics Department](http://linguistics.arizona.edu/) at the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [Human Language Technology Program](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/ms-hlt), the [Cognitive Science Program](https://cogsci.arizona.edu), the joint [Linguistics-Anthropology Ph.D. Program](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/joint-phd-anli), the [Graduate Certificate in Computational Social Science](https://css.arizona.edu/) and the [SLAT](https://slat.arizona.edu) program. My research areas include: phonology, morphology, computational linguistics, English phonology and morphology, poetic meter, psycholinguistics, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic.

**Materials associated with my books**

1.  [Programs](bookcode.zip) for my book *Python for Linguists*
1.  List of [errata](errata.html) from my book *The Phonology of English*.
1.  Programs from my book *Programming in Java for Linguists*. Available as a [gzipped tar
file](programs.tar.gz), as a [jar
file](programs.jar), or as a [zipped
archive](Programs.zip).
1.  Programs from my book *Programming in Perl for Linguists*. Available as a [gzipped tar file](perlprog.tar.gz), as a [zipped archive](perlprogs.zip). (The [websearch.pl](websearch.txt) program and [sentences.pl](sentences.txt) program can be downloaded separately.) [Answers](perlex.zip) to
selected exercises.
1.  List of [errata](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~hammond/perlerrata.html) from my book *Programming in Perl for Linguists*.

**Presentations**

1. [Slides and code](future.zip) for my presentation *Phonology looking forward* at the Iranian summer school (August 5, 2024).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some older computational projects with sentimental value**

1.  Gen with Lazy Evaluation: [paper](lazy.pdf) and [Haskell code](lazy.lhs). (Note that the code/paper are written in Literate Haskell style, which means the code file \"is\" the paper source.
1.  [Finite State Playground](flbi1.02.tar.gz). A set of xml-based command-line utilities for manipulating FSAs. These are **beta** and **not** industrial strength. Transducers are not included (v 1.02; 1/21/07).
1.  [LingML](http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hammond/lingml/lingml.html): This was a very rough idea for general XML/XSLT applications for linguistics analogous to the MathML initiative of the W3 consortium.
1.  Slides and demos from my presentation [\"Toward LingML: is the notation really the theory\"](http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hammond/georgia/gindex.html) (10/6/03).
1.  \"Parsing syllables: modeling OT computationally\", [Rutgers Archive](http://roa.rutgers.edu/)
([Code](mhlocweb))
1.  The [code](sylpars) in Perl for my 1995 constraint-based syllable parser. (The paper: \"Syllable parsing in English and French\", [Rutgers Archive](http://roa.rutgers.edu/))

**Accents**

Some years ago, the Arizona Department of Education had plans to bar teachers with "heavily accented or ungrammatical" speech from classrooms with English-learning children. The ostensible goal was to ensure that children would be exposed to examples of "perfect (unaccented) English." Some colleagues and I wrote an [op-ed](barring.pdf) about this and a larger group of colleagues from our department signed a [statement](ling_statement_final.pdf) drawing on our piece.
